WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net UPzynq20_test_design_i/IP_AXI_SerialBus_0/U0/IP_AXI_SerialBus_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UPzynq20_test_design_i/IP_AXI_SerialBus_0/U0/IP_AXI_SerialBus_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell UPzynq20_test_design_i/IP_AXI_SerialBus_0/U0/IP_AXI_SerialBus_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/reg_data_out_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
