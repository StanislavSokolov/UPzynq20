* The hardware which this example runs on, must have a serial FLASH (Numonyx
* N25Q, Winbond W25Q, or Spansion S25FL) for it to run. This example has been
* tested with the Numonyx Serial Flash (N25Q128).

* ----- --- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00  srt 06/20/12 First release
* 1.01  srt 04/26/13 Modified Erase function to perform Write Enable operation
*		     for each sector erase.
* 1.01  srt 08/28/13 Fixed the CR 731919, by setting the proper QSPI options.
* 5.0   sb  08/05/14 Added support for greater than 128MB flash operations.
